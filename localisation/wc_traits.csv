creature_human;Human;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_human_desc;This character is a human. Many years ago, when the Titans left Azeroth, the old gods sent the Curse of the Flesh to the Titans' countless creations. The curse failed to bring them under the old gods' sway, but the vrykul - gloomy, cruel, and warlike giants of the north - were created to protect other servants of the Titans. Because of the curse, Vrykul women began to give birth to weak, ugly children. King Imiron, the ruler of the whole Vrykul people, found out about this and believed that the Titans turned away from his people. Thus, he renounced the creators, ordering the killing of the "spoiled" offspring - but not all mothers fulfilled the king's decree. Those who could not do this fled to the south, and their children became the ancestors of man. Humans are one of the youngest races in Azeroth, but they have already withstood many trials with honour. Proud and unbending, humans are diverse and capable of any job, but are most skilled at diplomacy and solving problems peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_gnoll;Gnoll;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_gnoll_desc;Gnolls are cunning, animal-like folk - a hybrid of man with hyena. A big hump, a long neck, and clumsy fingers do not stop them from fighting, and conflict itself is a way of life for this race. Gnolls are very violent creatures, even over the smallest dispute, they are liable to gnaw at each other's throats - and in a literal sense, as they devour all creatures, including members of their own race. In their society, the Cult of Power flourishes. Tribal leaders are among the strongest, while the weak are consumed. Gnolls are lazy and primitive, as they have not yet mastered metalworking and still prefer a nomadic way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_murloc;Murloc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_murloc_desc;Murlocs are a strange combination of humanoid and fish, an ancient two-legged race of amphibians. They live along the coasts and within the depts of oceans, the coasts of lakes and rivers, as well as in underwater ruins. Murlocs are capable of breathing on land, although they rarely risk moving too far from water. Their hunched appearance is rather awkward, but don't let this mislead you - some murlocs travel overland with great speed and agility. Murlocs do not care about individuality or creativity, as this does not help the survival of the tribe or most of their race. They value obedience above all else. Agility and cruelty are also important to them, reflected in their hunting skills and strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_troll;Troll;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_troll_desc;Trolls are an ancient race, as mysterious as they are dangerous. Their numerous tribes inhabit every corner of the world. They have been at the center of a racial war with the men, dwarves, and elves of Azeroth since the beginning of their chronicles. All trolls have impressive physical regeneration, they may be cured of serious wounds and even restore lost limbs. They are larger than the average human. The colour of their skin ranges in a great variety, from light green and blue to dark gray. They are agile, cunning, and completely ruthless when they hunt their prey - no matter whether this prey is a wild animal or a sentient being. Undoubtedly, angering trolls or considering them primitive and stupid is a serious mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_ogre;Ogre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_ogre_desc;Ogres are tall and fat humanoids with huge arms and a large belly. They are extremely strong and love to demonstrate this fact. In battle, they are charging with a loud cry, most often wielding a giant club. Few can hold their own against an enraged ogre, and taking one down is even more difficult. The strongest warrior leads the tribe: no ogre questions the rule of the strongest. However, if the leader shows signs of weakness another ogre can challenge the chieftain in order to usurp his place. Although there are those in their society who are capable of mystical arts, the majority of ogres do not share this pursuit, for they are not particularly intelligent. A rare offshoot of the ogre race has two heads instead of one. The second head is almost always one-eyed, and, unfortunately, as stupid as the other head: the heads can conflict and even fight eachother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_orc;Orc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_orc_desc;Wild cinnamon or green-skinned orcs - natives of Draenor, who have recently arrived in Azeroth. Orc men are massive and horrific looking creatures, while most orc women are slightly shorter than most human men (and some of them are of the same height). Orcs have broad shoulders and muscular, strong bodies. To their enemies, they are beasts and fearsome opponents, unparalleled in their ferocity and cunning. But to their allies, orcs are noble and generous. For an orc, skill in battle brings great honour. Honour is the basic concept that lies in at the heart of the orc society, a concept that has driven their race to unite before great threats. Orcs seem quick-tempered, but they are honoured by the wisdom of their leaders and their shamans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
elemental_lord_fire;Firelord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
elemental_lord_fire_desc;The Lord of Fire is an incredibly strong ruler of fire elementals, and one of the four Elemental Lords. His plane is the Firelands, the realm of fire and ash, lying deep beneath the earth and the ocean within the realm of the elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
member_of_the_brotherhood_of_the_horse;Knight of the Brotherhood of the Horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
member_of_the_brotherhood_of_the_horse_desc;The Brotherhood of the Horse is an ancient order of the knights from the kingdom of Stormwind. It has existed since the man migrated from Strom, now known as the Arathi Highlands. Members of the brotherhood are the strongest soldiers in the azerothian military: among their ranks are the greatest and most famous knights and warriors of Stormwind, who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the good of their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
member_of_the_shadow_council;Member of the Shadow Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
member_of_the_shadow_council_desc;The Shadow Council is an organisation of warlocks from mortal peoples, which stands in the service of the demons of the Burning Legion. The Shadow Council was created by Gul'dan while he was still on Draenor, when the united clans of orcs began a war against the Draenei. The initial objectives of the council was to ensure stability in the war, which the Horde began against the Draenei, through the political manipulation of clans and the spread of sorcerous magic. With the invasion of the Horde into Azeroth, the Shadow Council has significantly expanded its sphere of influence not only inside the Horde, but also beyond its borders, by launching its networks to all corners of the known world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guardian_of_tirisfal;Guardian of Tirisfal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
guardian_of_tirisfal_desc;The Guardian of Tirisfal is a mortal champion selected by the Council of Tirisfal - a secret organisation including mages of humans, gnomes, and high elves - endowed with great magical powers to fight against the Burning Legion. When the Guardian grows old or gets tired of the endless fight against the chaos, the council selects a new guardian and gives him the power of his predecessor. For each generation, there is only one guardian, but due to his enormous magical power, he is able to fight against all demons invading Azeroth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tinker;Tinker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tinker_desc;Tinkers are one of the most intellectually developed types of azerothian adventurers. They are the creators of incredible inventions, from insane multi-purpose knives to chainsaws and steam tanks. Their inventions allow them to overcome almost any trouble they may face. And yet, despite all their help to society, engineers possess poor reputations as dangerous outcasts - mainly because of endless goblin experiments with explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
explorer;Explorer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
explorer_desc;Explorers are those brave souls who risk their lives for the sake of science and the expansion of the common store of knowledge for all inhabitants of Azeroth. They may also be scientists studying the societies of past centuries and travelers who provide a description of new territories and erase the void from maps of Azeroth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_naga;Naga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_naga_desc;The naga little resemble the nobility they once were. Their proud appearance has been warped and distorted, many of them received a number of special changes characteristical of the sea depths, such as an ability to release ink, tentacles, sharp scales, poisonous fangs, strong shells of mollusks, serpents instead of hair, large and sharp dorsal fins, and strong tails. In ancient times a matriarchy was established, when the witches and sirens developed stronger intellect and magical capabilities to control the entire community of naga. Males, who lost most of their magical powers during their transformation, acquired inhuman physical strength, and now constitute the main strike force of naga armies. In general, their exile has only strengthened the evil, vicious nature of these naked and sadistic creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_blood_elf;Blood Elf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_blood_elf_desc;The blood elves are a race formed from the high elves of Quel'thalas. In honour of their dead brethren, the survivors call themselves blood elves or Sin'dorei, which in thalassian means "children of blood". Both high elves and blood elves, regardless of class, status or origin, are fond of magic and have some addiction to it. But, unlike their original Quel'dorei brethren, all Sin'dorei siphon away the magical power off other beings. On average, blood elves are slightly taller than humans and considerably thinner in bone structure. Most of them have chiseled, regular features. The Quel'dorei heritage is expressed in light skin and golden hue of hair, although among the Sin'dorei, there are elves with unnaturally pale or unexpectedly swarthy complexions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_high_elf;High Elf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_high_elf_desc;The high elves, or Quel'dorei, are the absolute opposite of their cousins - the night elves (or Kaldorei). The Quel'Dorei are the descendants of those who served Azshara at the time of the first Well of Eternity, they took the light of the sun and left the darkness of the night. High elves are typically taller and more slender than humans. They are distinguished from the night elves by shorter ears and much smaller growth, among other physical differences. Quel'Dorei have fair skin, thin, and perfectly fair facial features - many of them are regarded as beautiful. However, despite their external beauty, high elves are quite narcissistic. The high elves used magic for generations, absorbing it with their mothers' milk. Even among those lacking a natural talent for magic, high elves cannot live or even think clearly if they do not receive their necessary mana requirement on a regular basis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_gnome;Gnome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_gnome_desc;Gnomes are a tiny race of technicians, mechanics, and inventors, known for their ingenious minds and eccentric character. Gnomes are very small - child-size - hardly more than a meter in height, and weigh only about twenty kilograms. Despite their small growth, they are quick and clever. For their small body, they have a disproportionately large head, almost the size of the rest of the body. Within these oversized skulls, all gnomes have the mind of a genius: the desire for invention, especially complex mechanical devices, is inlaid by nature, although some of these inventions are very dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_dwarf;Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_dwarf_desc;Dwarfs are small and stocky creatures that most often live in the mountains of Khaz Modan, the central part of the continent of the Eastern Kingdoms. Due to their physical attributes, they have excellent strength and endurance. A usual dwarf is stable, observant, and always ready for work or battle. He can be violent and angry or stubborn and persistent, depending on the situation. Although dwarves prefer to plan their actions in advance to overcome trouble, many of them will lose their temper when their feelings come into play. Many generations of dwarves are famous for their unsurpassed skill in working on metal and stone. They are masters of blacksmithing, and their jewelry, armor, and weapons are made perfectly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_kobold;Kobold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
creature_kobold_desk;Kobolds are a cowardly race of miners and candle manufacturers who resemble large and lean anthropoid rats, spending most of their life underground. The kobolds have a rather obsessive mindset of mining ores and digging tunnels - they grab any abandoned mine and pick up any tools remaining there, at least whenever they have a chance to do so with impunity. Of all the ores that can be mined in the earth, they are especially fond of gold. It seems that their race lives in darkness for the most part - but that's not the case. The kobolds in the mines rely on the light of their candles, which they wear directly on their heads and zealously guard against the hands of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
