ca_culture_zandalari_desc;While troll nations all over Azeroth are significantly adept in domesticating smaller breeds of dinosaurs, like raptors, the Zandalari trolls have become famous for their unparalleled ability in domesticating far more powerful dinosaurs such as devilsaurs and direhorns. To be able to field these beasts in war gives the Zandalari an enormous advantage unmet by any other nation on Azeroth.;;Während die Trollvölker in ganz Azeroth sehr geschickt sind in der Domestizierung kleinerer Dinosaurierrassen, wie z. B. Raptoren, sind die Zandalari-Trolle berühmt für ihre beispiellose Fähigkeit, weitaus mächtigere Dinosaurier wie Teufelssaurier und Terrorhörner zu zähmen.

ca_culture_satyr_desc;Descended from the highborne elves of old, the satyr are very magically inclined as a people, though cursed by Xavius and his dark affliction.

ca_culture_orc_4;Wolf Beastiary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_orc_desc;From beyond the Dark Portal, the orcs befriended and tamed the wolves of Draenor. With duties such as scouting and companionship, these large and swift canines were chosen as the orcs' favorite method of transportation that so well happened to be suited for war. Later when the orcs became more belligerent, these wolves were bred specifically for size and stamina so they could bear armoured riders into battle. The ferocity of the wolf and its rider shows in battle, leaving most soldiers trembling in fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_night_elf_desc;Many night elves learn to use weapons before they can walk, or so it is said, but their natural talent in archery is almost unrivaled. The Sentinel Army's archers are excellent hunters, but during wartime they become critical support troops, firing upon their enemies to give their allies a chance to regroup and counterattack. They are renowned for their ambush ability and skills in guerrilla warfare gained by training in the forests of Kalimdor. They maximize their ability by using speed, terrain and dark-vision to their full advantage. "One shot, one kill.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_gnoll_3;Gnoll Hut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_gnoll_4;Gnoll Hut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_gnoll_desc;Gnolls are primitive, violent brutes, viewing the entire world around them as a source of meat for their insatiable hunger. Reckless and undisciplined, they choose to overwhelm any opponents they encounter, using raw strength and superior numbers to make up for their lack of tactical ability. Though often nomadic, they have been known to build crude huts when finding a desirable resource to exploit, whether gold or food. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_ogre_4;Ogre Mound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_ogre_desc;Among the largest of Azeroth's sapient races, ogres are extremely strong and durable, albeit often simple. Their stature and physical prowess makes them fearsome warriors, though some show an affinity towards earth magic or the arcane. The most magically gifted of ogres, the ogre magi, are born with two heads, making them far more intelligent than their single-headed brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_magnataur_4;Magnataur Den;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_magnataur_desc;Magnataurs are colossal, aggressive creatures, with the body and tusks of a wooly mammoth and the torsos of a giant. They seemingly hate everything around them, even each other, most living in solitude or only with frost kobold worshippers.

ca_culture_draenei_4;Elekk Pasture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_draenei_desc;Upon their arrival on Draenor, the draenei found herds of gentle, elephant-like creatures known as elekks. Succeeding in domesticating them, the draenei developed such a bond with the species that they brought elekks with them on their escape from Outland.

ca_culture_murloc_desc;Though the magic of murlocs is relatively primitive to other shamanic cultures, murlockind shows a great aptitude and connection to water and earth elemental magics.

ca_culture_highborne_4;Highborne Pinnacle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_highborne_desc;The highborne elves are a dying breed of descendants from Azshara's great empire from long ago. Even though it has been so long, the highborne still find themselves incredibly skilled with arcane magic and enchantments, so much so that highborne society finds everything and everyone infused and empowered by some article of magical enchantment. Near the center of it all is this enormous pinnacle built to better concentrate the ley energies, what powers highborne society, from the surrounding landscapes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_gnome_4;Flying Machine Hangar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_gnome_desc;A technology that would later become the dwarven gyrocopter, the gnomish flying machine was created to supplement gnomekind's great ingenuity and handiwork skills and make up for their lack of any sort of physical strength. Though lightweight and lightly armoured, these flying machines serve as fantastic surveying tools, and they excel in hit and run attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_hozen_desc;A deeply passionate race, the hozen must spar with soft gloves to keep from killing one another in the heat of even a false battle.

ca_culture_aqir_4;Aqiri Barrows;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_aqir_desc;Creations of the Old Gods, the spiteful and evil Aqir were driven deep underground by the titan-forged centuries ago. There they found bones, metals and gems inaccessible by surface dwellers, managing to create weapons and trinkets that are among the strongest in the world before a disastrous war with the trolls caused them to splinter into multiple civilizations. Regardless of their form, they pose a dangerous threat to all life around them, gathering strength in deep, elaborate caverns, waiting for the right time to strike above ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_kobold_4;Kobold Mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_kobold_desc;Cowardly, dim, and weak, the rat-like kobolds stay in their mines away from civilization, digging for minerals to trade with harpies or goblins. Despite their desire to stay underground, they see very poorly in the dark, causing them to wear candles atop their heads. This need has caused them to develop a cultural attachment to their candles, with some tribes offering leadership to whoever's candle stands the tallest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_furbolg_4;Totem of Ursoc and Ursol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_furbolg_desc;The furbolg find themselves to be descendants of the wild god ancients Ursoc and Ursol. For some furbolgs however, reverence is not enough, and they choose to embody the might and ferocity of their gods, growing large and feral as they infuse themselves with the ancients' power. These are known as ursa totemics, and other furbolgs hold them in nearly as high regard as their shamans, recognizing their role in protecting and hunting for their tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_demonic_desc;The mo'arg represent one of the more versatile member races of the Legion, providing both brute strength and technical brilliance.

ca_culture_high_elf_4;Farstrider Lodge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_high_elf_desc;The Farstriders are an elite organization of elvish archers and among the very best with a bow that Azeroth has to offer. With a tradition that dates back to the Troll Wars, they devote themselves to eradicating evil both in their homelands and elsewhere and uphold honour and the law with a righteous fervour. Despite their respect for the law, they operate separate from the military, using their independence to further their ideals with minimal political interference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_centaur_4;Centaur Camp;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_centaur_desc;Brutal and barbaric, the centaurs are a relatively young but powerful species. The children of Zaetar, son of Cenarius, and Theradras, an earth elemental princess, centaurs are half-horse and half-human with the body of rather ugly humans above the torso and the body of a draft horse below it. Their culture is almost entirely war-driven, whether they are fighting with other centaur bands or the various races unlucky enough to settle near them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_goblin_4;Shredder Garage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_culture_goblin_desc;When it comes to the use of mechanical know-how to mete out reckless yet efficient destruction, the goblins are second to none. This even applies to their lumber harvesting techniques, where they skip axes in favor of Shredders, large mechanical suits of armor equipped with buzzsaws and pincers for hands. Needless to say, a walking suit of armor with a buzzsaw for a hand has its military uses as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_culture_dragon_desc;Dragons are the Titans' chosen stewards of the world.

In battle there are few foes that can match their might as even the strongest warriors fall before their titanic strenght.;;Von den Titanen erschaffen, um die frostigen Berge Azeroths zu schützen und zu bewachen, sind die Riesen ein kriegerisches und doch ehrenwertes Volk.
