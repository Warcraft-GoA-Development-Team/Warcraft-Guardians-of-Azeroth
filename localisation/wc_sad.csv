EVTDESC_WCCLS_10002;After a few hours of searching the wilds you notice a large transparent panther near the lake.;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10002;I should try to approach him.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10003;The cat spirit looks upon you with a calm and peaceful gaze, You hear a voice speak to you as though it was coming from the cat, but the creature makes no indication that it is speaking.

EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10003;What do you represent, spirit ?;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10004;I represent the agility which bolsters you as a young druid. You have come to me to learn this power young one, and I will teach this to you. I will teach you all that is the spirit cat, provided you will listen and understand.

EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10004;I seek to understand the importance of quickness of the body.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10005;Power of the body is the power and swiftness of action. You must keep yourself fit at all times, both physically and mentally.

These are surprises you will use to your advantage. You must rely on the slenderness of the cat's body in order to master the way of the claw.;;;

EVTDESC_WCCLS_10006;Resolve of the heart is what gives you the swiftness to take action... action that is rooted in intents that are pure and forthright. To keep the balance is not to be complacent or banal. You must show resolve for that which you believe in, and you must be willing to fight for it. The mother cat shows endless conviction in protecting her young, as does an elder cat protecting his hunting grounds. It is this resolve, this resolve of the heart, which you must come to know if you are to master the way of the Claw.;;;

You must face your foe as the cat would - with quickness of body and with resolve of the heart. Learn from the fight, young one. Go... with my blessings.;;;

EVTDESC_WCCLS_10040;Mistery of flight are only known to most talented druids. Your best chance of learning them would be to seek out a Druid of the Talon.

They commonly live in high altitude areas where their connection with Mistress of Birds is the strongest.;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10040;Which way to the highest mountain ?;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10041;After long journey you finally arrived at the foot of a mountain. Climbing such a enormous peak is no easy matter and you decide it's best to make camp and spend the night here.;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10041;I need a good sleep to climb that mountain.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10042;You're waken up by loud caws outside your tent. You leave it quickly to look for a culprit but the crow is nowhere to be found. You're confused by this situation. How can a simple crow elude an experienced druid such as yourself ?;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10042;Maybe it's a sign ?;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10043;After weird wakeup you eat a modest breakfast and start climbing the mountain. You estimate that it will take you a few hours to reach it's peak. You can only hope that there's actually a Druid of the Talon living there.;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10043;I wish i could fly to the top.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10044;It's nearly dark but you have finally arrived at the mountain's peak. You're tired and dream only of warm bed back home. And then you suddenly hear a loud caw behind you. It's a crow but not an ordinary one. It's several times bigger and a lot more deadlier. It looks at you and then transforms into a tall night elf. You can see by his appearance that he's person you've looking for.;;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10044;I should talk to him.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10045;You approach him and introduce yourself shortly. He looks at you intensely with his sharp eyes before opening his mouths. "I know what you seek my friend. Mysteries of the flight are only known to a select few and i can see in you potential to join them.";;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10045;I will prove that i'm worthy.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10046;"Prove ? No my friend, there's no need for that. There is no exam to pass, no challenge to complete, no problem to overcome. I will pass onto you my knowledge and if you're worthy you will understand it.";;;
EVTOPTA_WCCLS.10046;Then i'm ready to learn.;;;
EVTDESC_WCCLS_10047;"Good, my friend. Then i will tell you the secret of flight. It's knowing the true meaning of freedom. As a druid it's your duty to protect Azeroth. You can't just fly away from your obligations and hide in the clouds. The only thing that's limiting your freedom is you. Your doubts, concerns and fears chained you to the earth. True freedom is facing them head on and standing your ground instead of flying away like a coward. This is the mystery of flight. Now take to the skies and feel how free you are !";;;

EVTDESC_WCCLS_10060;You have been studying ways of druidism for many years now. You practiced shapeshifting and attained complete control over it's many forms. But now you choose a new objecitve.

EVTDESC_WCCLS_10063;The ritual has begun. As the world swirls around you the vision blurs and you start to hear weird sounds. You see the Defiler before you.

You reach your enemy and he barely dodges your attack, saving himself from being impaled. You exhange blows for hours and you you're getting more and more tired with each passing moment. Archimonde notices it and grabs your neck with his demonic strength. You struggle to free yourself but to no avail. He snaps your neck and as you leave the vision the last thing you hear is powerful roar of furious Ysera.;;;
