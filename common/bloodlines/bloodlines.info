Bloodlines are modifiers that can be inherited through characters and show up in various interfaces. Bloodlines can be saved in event targets.

Custom loc:
	Bloodlines can be referenced in custom loc via saved event targets, and via things that provide bloodlines as scopes (E.G., bloodline names and descriptions have "FROM" as the bloodline itself).
	Within a bloodline scope, you can do the following:
	
	Founder - Promote to the founder of the bloodline
	
	GetFoundationDate - Get the date the bloodline was founded
