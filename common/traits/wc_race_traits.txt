# Hello there! When creating a new race,
# don't forget to add/edit race scripted triggers, effects and events.
#
# To-do/to-check list:
# * Add new potential_race_<your race>_trigger
# * Add this trigger to WCSUP.1
# * Add your race to has_race_trait_trigger
# * Add your race to has_prev_race_trigger
# * Check can_marry_trigger, maybe this's what you need?
# * Check is_humanoid_trigger and the like
# * Add your race to remove_racial_traits_effect
# * And of course, check and edit wc_race_events
# * Don't forget about portrait!... do you know how to add it?
# And the most important rule...
# Just follow examples, because our ancestors couldn't make mistakes... right?

# Note: AI behavior modifiers are pretty minor because there's add_default_traits effect.
# It adds personality traits depending on race, religion etc.
# So race traits only partially affect AI behavior.
